Sumbisson to the 2025 NFL Big Data Bowl. The decision to attack or contain is constantly running through every defensive player's mind as they react to the ball being thrown. Often, choosing to attack can result in being burned and allowing a massive play, but when that gamble pays off it can lead to a game changing moment. Our project aims to create a multiclass classification system to determine when a defensive player should attack the ball or try to contain the receiver.
